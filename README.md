📊 IBM Data Analytics Capstone Project: Insurance Charges Prediction

This repository contains my final project for the IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate insurance charges based on individual health and demographic data. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model development and evaluation.

The analysis is performed in the Insurance_Anaysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

🚀 Project Overview

The project follows a standard data science pipeline:

*     Data Loading and Cleaning: Handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
*     Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand distributions and relationships between features.
*     Feature Engineering: Transforming features and creating new ones to improve model performance.
*     Model Building: Developing and evaluating several machine learning models, including:
         - Multiple Linear Regression 
         - Polynomial Regression 
         - Ridge Regression 
*     Model Evaluation & Comparison: Analyzing and comparing the performance of each model using metrics like R-squared to select the best one.

📈 Key Findings

The analysis confirmed that the relationship between the features and insurance charges is non-linear. The Polynomial Regression Model significantly outperformed the linear models, achieving an R-squared score of 0.84. This highlights the importance of using appropriate models that can capture complex data relationships.
